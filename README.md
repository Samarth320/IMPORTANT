1.Data Wrangling I Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (eg. 
data.csv) 1. Import all the required Python Libraries. 2. Locate an open source data from the web 
(eg. https://www.kaggle.com). Provide a clear description of the data and its source (i.e. URL of the 
web site). 3. Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe. 4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing 
values in the data using pandas isnull(), describe() function to get some initial statistics. Provide 
variable descriptions. Types of variables etc. Check the dimensions of the data frame. 5. Data 
Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking the data types 
(i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the data set. If variables are 
not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions. 6. Turn categorical variables into 
quantitative variables in Python

3.Basic Statistics - Measures of Central Tendencies and Variance Perform the following operations 
on any open source dataset (eg. data.csv) 1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, 
maximum, standard deviation) for a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by 
one of the qualitative (categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups 
and quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the age 
groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical variable. 2. 
Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, standard 
deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’ of iris.csv dataset.

9. Data Visualization II 1. Use the inbuilt dataset 'titanic' as used in the above problem. Plot a box 
plot for distribution of age with respect to each gender along with the information about whether 
they survived or not. (Column names : 'sex' and 'age') Write observations on the inference from the 
above statistics
